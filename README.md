Equine Trivia Game, Option 1
created by Jennifer Gaumnitz

WHAT THE PROJECT DOES

Here's how the quiz works:

* There are 10 horse-related trivia questions, each with 4 multiple choice options to choose from.

* The player has 60 seconds to complete the quiz. They may only pick one answer per question. A countdown timer is displayed.

* The game ends when the time runs out or the player clicks the "Whoa!" button. The page reveals the number of questions that the player answered correctly and incorrectly or left unanswered.

WHY THE PROJECT IS USEFUL

  The game fulfills a homework assignment for University of Kansas Coding Boot Camp, August 2019 to February 2020. Besides continuing to work with jQuery and JavaScript and writing items dynamically to the DOM, the assignment also taught me how to work with a timer function in JavaScript.

HOW YOU CAN GET STARTED WITH THE PROJECT

  Just push the "Giddy-up" button to begin the game. Push the "Whoa!" button if you finish answering all 10 questions before the 60 seconds has expired.
